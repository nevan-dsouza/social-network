## Installation

Type "npm install" in the console to install the dependancies this application requires (Express, Mongoose, dayjs).

## Usage

There are a few things that must be done in order to run this software. To begin, the user must have MongoDB installed so that the database and schema are built automatically when the program is run. Second, in a terminal, enter "npm install" (ensure you're in the repo directory), which will install mongoose, dayjs, and express. To start the server, type "npm start." Objects will now be shown at localhost:3001/api/. Examine the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE http methods with a tool like Insomnia.
